{"name":"Meta-csp-framework","tagline":"The Meta-CSP Framework: a Java API for meta-constraint reasoning","body":"# What is meta-constarint reasoning?\r\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) consist of a finite set of variables, each associated with a finite domain, and a set of constraints which restrict simultaneous assignments to variables. A Meta-CSP is CSP formulation of a combinatorial problem which builds on lower-level CSPs.\r\n\r\n# What does this API do?\r\n\r\nThis software framework provides tools for developing solvers for problems that can be cast as Meta-CSPs. The framework includes several built-in CSP and Meta-CSP problem solvers which can be used as \"ingredients\" for defining more sophisticated solvers. Among these, hybrid problem solvers which exemplify the natural predisposition of Meta-CSPs for solving hybrid reasoning problems.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nDevelopers can refer to the API documentation (Javadoc) for reference, and to the examples below for getting started.\r\n\r\n# Using the framework as a library\r\n\r\nThe Meta-CSP Framework is available on Maven Central.\r\n\r\nMaven dependency declaration:\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.metacsp</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>meta-csp-framework</artifactId>\r\n  <version>1.0.394</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGradle dependency declaration:\r\n```\r\ncompile 'org.metacsp:meta-csp-framework:1.0.394'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, get the <a href=\"http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.metacsp%22%20AND%20a%3A%22meta-csp-framework%22\">latest binary, source and Javadoc JARs from the Maven Central website</a>.\r\n\r\n# Template project\r\n\r\nA template project is available in the branch ```project-template```, download it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone -b project-template https://github.com/FedericoPecora/meta-csp-framework.git project-template\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee <a href=\"\">Gradle build instructions</a> for compilation and use with Eclipse.\r\n\r\n# Compiling from source\r\n\r\nThe framework as well as the API documentation (Javadoc) can be built through <a href=\"http://www.gradle.org/\">Gradle</a>. A Gradle redistributable is included in the master branch, so there is no need to install Gradle on your machine.\r\n\r\n## Gradle build instructions\r\n\r\nEnter the directory with the file build.gradle and issue the command:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew install    #(on Unix-based systems)\r\n$ gradlew.bat install  #(on Windows-based systems)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test the build, issue the following:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew run        #(on Unix-based systems)\r\n$ gradlew.bat run      #(on Windows-based systems)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ```clean``` target will clean up the build directory. The target ```javadoc``` can be used to generate the API documentation (Javadoc), which will be placed in ```build/docs/javadoc```.\r\n\r\n## Preparing an Eclipse project\r\n\r\nIf developing in Eclipse, consider using the eclipse target:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew eclipse    #(on Unix-based systems)\r\n$ gradlew.bat eclipse  #(on Windows-based systems)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will prepare the directory with ```.classpath```, ```.settings``` and ```.project``` files. The directory can then be used as source for a new Eclipse project which will have all dependencies properly set.\r\n\r\n## Using the compiled library in other Gradle projects\r\n\r\nThe install target builds the artifact ```meta-csp-framework-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```, and places it into your local Maven repository (the location is ```~/.m2/repository/org/metacsp/meta-csp-framework/``` on a Unix-based system). You can use the newly compiled version of the framework in another Gradle-based project by including the following in the project's ```build.gradle```:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrepositories {\r\n   mavenLocal()\r\n   //any other repo you may need for your project\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n   compile 'org.metacsp:meta-csp-framework:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT'\r\n   //any other dependency you may have\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Sponsors\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"http://www.oru.se/\">&Ouml;rebro University</a>\r\n* <a href=\"http://project-race.eu/\">FP7 Project RACE (Robustness by Autonomous Competence Enhancement)</a>\r\n* <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html\">The 7<sup>th</sup> EU Framework Programme</a>\r\n* <a href=\"http://www.kk-stiftelsen.org/\">The Swedish Knowledge Foundation</a>\r\n","google":"UA-36266754-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
